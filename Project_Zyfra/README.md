# Machine Learning - Gold Recovery Optimization

## Project Description:
Prepare a prototype of a machine learning model for Zyfra. The company develops efficiency solutions for heavy industry. The model should predict the amount of gold recovered from gold ore. You have the data on extraction and purification. The model will help to optimize the production and eliminate unprofitable parameters.

You need to: Prepare the data; Perform data analysis; Develop and train a model.

## Project Instructions:

Step 1: Prepare the data
1. Open the files and look into the data.
2. Check that recovery is calculated correctly. Using the training set, calculate recovery for the rougher.output.recovery feature. Find the MAE between your calculations and the feature values. Provide findings.
3. Analyze the features not available in the test set. What are these parameters? What is their type?
4. Perform data preprocessing.

Step 2: Perform Data Analysis
1. Take note of how the concentrations of metals (Au, Ag, Pb) change depending on the purification stage.
2. Compare the feed particle size distributions in the training set and in the test set. If the distributions vary significantly, the model evaluation will be incorrect.
3. Consider the total concentrations of all substances at different stages: raw feed, rougher concentrate, and final concentrate. Do you notice any abnormal values in the total distribution? If you do, is it worth removing such values from both samples? Describe the findings and eliminate anomalies. 

Step 3: Develop and Train a model
1. Write a function to calculate the final sMAPE value.
2. Train different models. Evaluate them using cross-validation. Pick the best model and test it using the test sample. Provide findings.

## Project Notes:
- Data is indexed with the date and time of acquisition (date feature). Parameters that are next to each other in terms of time are often similar.
- Some parameters are not available because they were measured and/or calculated much later. That's why, some of the features that are present in the training set may be absent from the test set. The test set also doesn't contain targets.
- The source dataset contains the training and test sets with all the features.
- You have the raw data that was only downloaded from the warehouse. Before building the model, check the correctness of the data. For that, use our instructions.

## Project Learnings:
✔️ Thorough data preparation and thoughtful handling of missing values with `ffill`.

✔️ Skilled use of visualizations to explore data and support data findings.

✔️ Excellent application of kfold validation and use of multiple models to explore optimization.

✔️ Well written comments and conclusion.
